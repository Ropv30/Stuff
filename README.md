# blacky-official-css-bhop-timer

Still functional in 08-2018, version 1-8-3
The reason i'm sharing this is that cs:source is dead 

Indisputeble the best bhop timer ever made for source, but nowhere to be found online.
There is one open source version but it doesn't work anymore, this one does. Easy to setup and manage.

For people like me who still play once a while competetive with friends on local server.
This timer has the best replay (ghost) bot plugin, and includes everything you need for a fully functional bhop server.

I also have 600 bhop maps in one big file, pm if interested..
