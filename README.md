Still working for cs:course in 08-2018, version 1-8-3.

Indisputeble the best bhop timer ever made, but nowhere to be found online.
There is one open source version online, it doesn't work. This one does. Easy to setup and manage.

For people like me who still play once a while competetive with friends on local server.
This timer has the best replay (ghost) bot plugin, and includes everything you need for a fully functional bhop server.
